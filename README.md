placeGoat
=========

**As of Feb 2022, this service is shut down for good. RIP to all the unit tests I wrote using this service for dummy data. So long and thanks for all the goats.**

Placeholder services are cool. Goats are cool (Especially those yelling ones). placeGoat combines those two things.

Technologies
------------
Turns out hosting an EC2 instance is expensive, and I've switched to Node.js primarily, so I rebuilt this in Node and it's running on Heroku.
~~I wanted to learn some new software while strengthing my knowledge in others, so placeGoat is built with PHP and the [Slim framework](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim). The server itself is running nginx on an Amazon ec2 micro instance.~~

### TO-DO
* ~~Add more goats~~
* ~~Add a goat counter~~
* ~~Also, some yaks~~
